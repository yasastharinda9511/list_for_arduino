# list_for_arduino


I think you may aldready deal with arduino.If you are familiar with python, there is a data type list but there is no data type inside arduino like list (in c++ vectors).
Therefore I found my own solution to overcome this problem.

I wrote my own header file and c++ file to overcome this problem using basics of pointers and memory allocations in c.

Basic I used 3 main basic functions of C++.
1.  ```malloc```
2.  ```realloc```
3.  ```dealloc```
