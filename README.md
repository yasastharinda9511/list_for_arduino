# list_for_arduino


I think you aldready deal with arduino.If you are familiar with python, there is no any data structure similar to the list in python.
Therefore I found my own solution to overcome this solution.

I wrote my own header file to overcome this problem using basics of pointers and memory allocations in c.

Basic I used 3 main basic functions of C++.
1.  ```Malloc```
2.  ```realloc```
3.  ```dealloc```
